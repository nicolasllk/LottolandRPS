Lottoland Rock, Paper, Scissors
=====
Back-end Java Challenge
First Part
● Write a program to play rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).
● There will be 2 kinds of players, one should always choose randomly, the other
should always choose rock.
● The program will be a web, with a single view containing the next elements:
	o "Play Round" button that will play an automatic round
	o Field showing the number of rounds played by that user so far.
	o Table showing the rounds played, with 3 columns: what 1st player chose,
	what second chose, and the result of the round (that could be player 1
	wins, player 2 wins or draw)
	o There will be a button: "Restart game" that will set round count for that
	user to 0 and also clean the table.

● Many users accessing the URL in their own browsers should be able to play the
game independently, with their own counters and rounds info tables.
